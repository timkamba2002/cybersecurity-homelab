Snort IDS Lab
Overview

This lab demonstrates the deployment and testing of Snort as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in a virtualized home lab environment. Snort was configured to monitor network traffic and generate alerts for suspicious activity, specifically ICMP traffic generated from a Kali Linux attacker machine.

The goal of this lab was to gain hands-on experience with:

IDS configuration

Network traffic monitoring

Alert generation and analysis

Understanding how malicious activity is detected

Lab Environment

Virtualization: Oracle VirtualBox

Machines Used:

Snort VM – IDS sensor

Kali Linux – Attacker machine

Network Setup:

Internal network (host-only / internal LAN)

Snort positioned to monitor traffic between hosts

Tools & Technologies
